                            <p> Just curious, does anyone here consider Before Watchmen to be canon? It plays a little fast and loose with some things, and while I know according to DC it's "technically" canon; because of some of the discrepancies in continuity I don't. I view it as a separate world, as Watchmen the movie is separate to Watchmen the comic. Anyone else? . . . P.S. On that note, since HBO's Watchmen is a successor to original comic, not the movie, if they choose to add Before Watchmen content ''' I read it was after Alan Moore's Watchmen comic. ü§∑ ''' Context Link (https://reddit.com/r/history/comments/aaworo/comment/ecw5619?context=999) Go1dfish undelete link ( unreddit undelete link (https://unreddit.com/r/history/comments/aaworo/comment/ecw5619?context=999) Author: /u/Vaguely-witty. I was just thinking about rereading the comic and I was curious. Personally, the moment at the end of #11 where Bernard grabs Bernie really hit me hard. Second to that is the scene with the Intrinsic Field Subtractor 
Hi so i love the watchmen movie and I just finished the comic book. I saw that there are more comics released that I didn't know about but I can't seem to find a proper list of how many there are and which order they have been released in. Does anybody have a list and also if you've read them what did you think of them? Sorry if this question is not suited for this sub, couldn't think of a more suitable one. Thanks. I already know that this will be a very unpopular opinion, but I haven't really enjoyed Watchmen. I found it not boring but neither extremely exciting. This isn't my first comic but at the same time I haven't read tons of material, so maybe in the future, reading it again, o will appreciate it, but at the moment, to me is just a normal comic book. Maybe I was just expecting a lot but, I don't know, I'm kinda disappointed. The only part I've really enjoyed are the talks between Rorschach So Watchmen ends with Ozymandias faking an alien attack in order for humanity to come together to fight a greater threat. What happens after a few years if there are no more attacks? Wouldn't things go back to the way they were before, but worse now that there are a whole lot of anti alien weapons? Does Ozymandias plan on faking an attack every few years to maintain a forced peace. I guess the title says it all. As a new reader, I'm looking for stories to give me sense of who those people are, their intentions and how they became heroes or villains. 
I have read the first one and I know the Watchmen are in the DC Universe now, so do I need to read anything prior to the new comic other than the original. I wanted to say crowd fund it, but I imagine any money made from it would spur a copyright lawsuit. Seems like maybe ahead of schedule those awesome Batman, Wonder Woman, and Superman X Watchmen Blood splatter shirts are up on Graphitti!
